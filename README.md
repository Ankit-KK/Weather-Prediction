# Weather Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict weather conditions using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical weather data to forecast future weather conditions accurately.

## Features
- Data Collection: Historical weather data collected from various sources.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
- Model Training: Using various machine learning algorithms to train the model.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model.
- Predictions: Generating weather forecasts based on the trained model.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: For data analysis and model training.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding environment.
